In this tutorial you will learn how you can setup Nix Package Manager and how you can use it in order to manage your package versions.

You will start with a basic Ubuntu Linux in which you will setup the Nix Package Manager. You will then learn how to install a package using the *nix-env* command.
After that you will setup a *nix flake* and change a few of it's packages in order to control your package versions for your different projects.

Finally, you will look at a more advance *nix flake* with more advanced features so you can get a better idea of what the possibilities of Nix Package Manager are.

To start, move into your home folder:
```
cd ~
```{{exec}}
